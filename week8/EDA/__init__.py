# Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) 
# is a software design pattern that revolves around the concept of events. 
# In this architecture, the flow of the system is determined by events that 
# occur within it. An event can be any significant occurrence or change 
# in state within the system, such as a user action, a sensor reading, 
# a message arrival, or a database update.
