# Model-View-Controller (MVC) with Observer 
# the View autonomously reacts to changes in the Model without 
# direct intervention from the Controller. This paradigm shift is 
# facilitated by modern frameworks and libraries that support reactive 
# programming and data binding, enabling seamless synchronisation between 
# the UI and underlying data. This approach enhances application responsiveness,
# facilitates real-time updates, and simplifies testing and maintenance by 
# promoting better separation of concerns. It finds utility across various 
# domains, including front-end web development, desktop, and mobile applications, 
# especially in contexts requiring dynamic and highly responsive user interfaces.
