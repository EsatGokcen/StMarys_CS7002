# MVVM Pattern
# In MVC, the Controller mediates between Model and View, 
# while in MVVM, the ViewModel abstracts View from Model, 
# promoting better separation of concerns. MVVM leverages data binding for 
# automatic updates between View and ViewModel, enhancing testability and 
# maintainability.
