# Abstract Factory Pattern
# is a creational design pattern that provides an interface 
# for creating families of related or dependent objects without 
# specifying their concrete classes. It allows the creation of objects 
# that are related by a common theme, such as products of the same family, 
# while ensuring that the created objects are compatible with each other.
