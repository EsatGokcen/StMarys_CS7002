# Factory Merthod
# is a creational design pattern that provides an interface 
# for creating objects but allows subclasses to alter 
# the type of objects that will be created. 
# It is used when a class cannot anticipate 
# the class of objects it must create, 
# or when a class wants its subclasses to specify the objects it creates.
