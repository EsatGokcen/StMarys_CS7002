# Adapter Pattern 
# This is a structural design pattern that allows 
# incompatible interfaces to work together. 
# It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces by 
# providing a wrapper or intermediary that translates the interface of 
# one class into another interface that a client expects.
