# the simple factory is a creational design pattern
# that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass 
# but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. 
# It is used to encapsulate object creation logic and promote loose coupling 
# by ensuring that the code that creates objects 
# does not need to know the specific class of the object being created.
